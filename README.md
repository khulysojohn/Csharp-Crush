# C# Course - Beginner Repository

Welcome to the ** C# Course Repository**! This repository I designed for beginning to learn C# through practical examples. Each branch in this repository corresponds to a specific topic or section covered in the FreeCodeCamp C# course, allowing you to explore code examples, exercises, and solutions related to each lesson.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized with multiple branches, each focused on a different aspect of the C# course. To access code for a particular topic, switch to the respective branch.
